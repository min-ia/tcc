 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  % In the last years there was a growing emergence of companies called startups.
  % These companies aim to seek, as soon as possible, a repeatable and scalable
  % business model that creates market innovation. In this context was born the
  % startup Rua Dois with the purpose of innovating the real estate market. 
  % However, during their quest for innovation and scalability the software
  % development process was disturbed. Leading to some technical decisions that
  % made it difficult for software to evolve at the same speed as the company wanted.
  % Consequently, it was necessary to simplify the entire architecture of the
  % software developed in order to better adapt to the current startup context. The
  % present work will perform a comparative analysis between the two architectures
  % adopted in the company in order to evaluate them and define possible guidelines
  % that guide the Rua Dois regarding their expectations of scalable software
  % development.
